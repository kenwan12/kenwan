INSTALLATION for Version 2.1.8
==============================

1.	Check can connect to	TSD  (i.e. tsd.... or its IP)   Port 4242
	- see settings in   globals.ps1


2.	Copy the content of the SVN folder i.e. ...\winsys_eu\OpenTSDB to 	C:\'Program Files'\OpenTSDB
	(create it if necessary)


3.	To use the default colelction i.e. the baseline set of system metrics, you can simply run

	& C:\'Program Files'\OpenTSDB\config.ps1

4.	Test run with	.\collector.ps1 default 10
	to see if you do get the metrics info displayed interactively

5.	Test run with	C:\'Program Files'\OpenTSDB\OpenTSDB.exe

	And check the folder   data\done\YYYYMMDD   for files generated to ensure everything is correct
	- need to wait for a few minutes perhaps

6.	Make it into a service by		.\nSet_Service.ps1  OpenTSDB
	then run command 			Start-Service OpenTSDB


NB:	If there is any change in the   globals.conf   i.e. add more metric sets or split them into smaller sets etc.,
	remember to restart the  OpenTSDDB  service for changes to be picked up

	Please DO make use of the step 3 & 4 for your testing of the results of any change made if not sure
	before restarting the OpenTSDB service :-)
