1. Windows tcollector (wtcollector.ps1) + default collector (collector.sp1) written in PowerShell

2. Each collector can be run as

   collector.sp1 metric_set [loop_time]

   The metric_set metrics are given in 2 files : metric_set._s for static metrics and metric_set._n for non-static metrics
   with loop_time default to 30s

   The file are refreshed via a call to the nget_config.ps1 script
   which regenerate non-static metrics every loop and static ones for the static file is NOT found

   This script must be able to be run as a job via start-job

3. The wtcollector :-

   The tcollector in Windows conforms to the Linux version of running the collector(s) found under
   the loop_time folder(s) under the collectors folder

   It will start such collector(s) when the it first starts and then collect the outputs of all the collector(s)
   every loop_time (default is 30s)

   It will re-start folder 0 jobs if they are found not running at each loop - just make sure the programs are there !!!

                                            use   get-counter   to retrieve the metrics values




4. Use a C# OpenTSDB.exe file to call OpenTSDB.ps1

5. Use srvany.exe of Windows Resource Kits to create the service with the nSet_Service.ps1 script
