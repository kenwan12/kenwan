For working with Windows OpenTSDB version 2.1.5 or above


To make use of the OpenTSDB PowerShell suite implemented, external programs are assumed to behave as follows :-

1.	output each metric per line to standard output whereas errors should be written elsewhere


	TSD_metric_name Epoch_time Metric_value tag1=value1 tag2=value2 tag3=value3 ...


	where	TSD_metric_name			win.asp.net_apps_v4.0.30319   (spaces replaced by _)


		Essential tags include :-		Example

		type=				anonymous_requests/sec
		host=				mysite1.co.uk
		cluster=			nexus
		class=				www
		instance=			mysite.co.uk

	For getting the right tags in PowerShell, there is a get_tags function defined by

	globals.ps1

	under C:\Program Files\OpenTSDB

	Please refer to   w3wp_metrics.ps1   for an illustration


2.	can be run from Powershell interactively and as a background job


3.	should take at least 2 arguments :-
	1st parameter :	metric_set/collection_set   (which the program may.may not sue it for checking)
	2nd parameter :	the number of seconds per loop   (if less than or equal to 0, set to 30 by default)
